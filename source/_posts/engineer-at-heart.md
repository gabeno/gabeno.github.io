I hold a Civil Eng (Bachelors) degree yet work in the software development industry. It is a journey I relish and hereby share with you my little story.

### _Flashback_

For a long time, I have had an penchant for solving problems and building stuff. A case in point: in my childhood is that I did not have the pleasure to be bought toys and well, being a boy like any other out there, this was a real issue. Mostly, I would borrow from my generous friends - I could only get their broken toys! The ones that they no longer derived pleasure from :) I extremely was fascinated by a remote-controlled toy car back then. And my DIY instincts kicked in! I ingeniously resorted to building my own.


I assembled my basic version of an electric toy car using a set of [gears](https://www.amazon.com/Lucksender-Plastic-Single-Double-Reduction/dp/B00V66YJQI/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1514643478&sr=8-2&keywords=plastic+gears+for+small+motors) connected to a [motor](https://www.amazon.com/Flormoon-Electric-0-5-3V-15000RPM-Magnetic/dp/B01I6MDXV6/ref=lp_3753381_1_29_sspa?s=lamps-light&ie=UTF8&qid=1512128213&sr=1-29-spons&psc=1) mounted on a cardboard base with rubber wheels. Another important component was an [AC-DC voltage adapter to step](https://www.amazon.com/VCT-VX-79NP-Multi-Purpose-Converter-Selection1-5/dp/B0014JUGTQ/ref=sr_1_18?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1512128917&sr=1-18&keywords=ac+dc+adapter) for stepping down electricity from the mains to something that could safely drive the motor. I was so happy with myself at this accomplishment and especially after collecting the materials over a period of time since they were not easy to come by. I can hear you ask if I still have this gem - unfortunately no! It was blown up by my kid sister who did not know that one needs to power it via the AC-DC adapter.


By the foregoing and other similar instances, I guess it was evident that indeed whatever I would end up doing would involve building things, and yes, it had to be engineering.

### _TLDR_

After the formative years in school I qualified and studied Civil engineering and after a few years of practice, I was still kind of unsettled. I did notice however, my increased interest in computers during the proliferation of the internet. I bought myself a laptop and started digging bit by bit into this maze of software world. This is how I spent most of my evenings after work. After considering a move for quite some time I eventually did jump ship, a move many of my mates still gape at. With hindsight, I think it was the best decision I ever took, actually I should have taken it earlier.

I tell people who ask me why I did so that I am still engineering stuff; I still build stuff. Only this time not the enormous physical structures that form public infrastructure but software. I draw lots of parallel since both disciplines involve designing, building and maintaining the physical or software artefacts.

This blog is dedicated to writings where I intend to share my thoughts, learnings and projects. In my next post I will share my experience on studying by self.

Till then!
